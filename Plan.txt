It is a two player UNO game

we should linked lists to store the cards sequence and to keep track of all the cards that are present with a player

The Server will generate a list of cards (shuffled)  and  give the alternate 7 or 13 cards to each player

the cards are displayed according to the code they have

to select the card player should press the nmber of the card in their list and then they start the play

if there is one card they should type uno

when the number of cards in the list is 0 they win
